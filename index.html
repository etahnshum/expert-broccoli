      <p>The all dayer was a fun day. Fun games. I'm glad I didn't get sunburnt. prank calling scammers during lunch was humourous and particularly thought-provoking. Fun ice skating, but I'm not good at it because I fell 1 time. I had cold leftover panda express. <div>Click me to learn more.</div></p>

      <h1>All Dayer Highlight</h1>
      <p>The highlight was ice skating because it was something different from last year. It was also more fun, since I didn't stick to the wall the entire time. Hopefully next time I can be more confident in ice skating.</p>
